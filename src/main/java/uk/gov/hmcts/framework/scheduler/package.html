        <p>
This package contains the classes associated with a java.util.Timer based scheduler. The main
entry point is the Scheduler class that takes an instance of java.util.Properties to configure
which tasks are scheduled. 
        </p>
        <p>
The execution of the tasks is handled using a strategy pattern, using the TaskStrategy interface.
Two implementations of TaskStrategy are provided to allow trivial implementation of either Session
Bean based or plain java class tasks, RemoteSessionTaskStrategy and the JavaTasksStrategy. If wished Task
Strategy can be implemented for much more specific, configurable task execution.
        </p>
        <p>
The properties format expected by Schedulable are recorded in it's document set.
