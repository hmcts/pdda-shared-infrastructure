This package contains the Session Beans and associated classes for the public displays. The two session beans
have separate responsibilities.
		</p>
		<p>
<code>PublicDisplayConfigurationBean</code> is responsible for managing the
public display configuration data. It presents methods both for the maintenance of the data by a client and the
querying of the data by the render component. The transformation from the highly normalised entities addressed by
the administrative user managing the configuration and the de-normalised entities used by the render component is
handled hear by the <code>DisplayRotationSetDataHelper</code>.
		</p>
		<p>
<code>?????</code> is responsible for servicing the application data requests of the render component, using a set
of pre-defined queries it populates instances of the classes held in the
<code>uk.gov.hmcts.pdda.common.publicdisplay.renderdata</code> package.
