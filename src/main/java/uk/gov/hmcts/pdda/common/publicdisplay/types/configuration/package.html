This package contains the classes that represent the types of configuration changes and initialisations available
to public displays. The super-class is <code>CourtConfigurationChange</code>, this type of change is intended to be
the fail safe, should the configuration component not know how to handle a sub-class, it should treat it as a
configuration change for the whole court.
		</p>
		<p>
The sub-classes of <code>CourtConfigurationChange</code> represent the configuration changes available to a user of
the Public Display system. A <code>CourtDisplayConfigurationChange</code> represents a configuration change to the
a display and a <code>CourtRotationSetConfigurationChange</code> is a configuration change to a rotation set.
		</p>
		<p>
For the purposes of initialisation, all types of <code>CourtConfigurationChange</code> support the concept of
&apos;recreate&apos;, which tells the configuration component to produce as render changes all elements associated with
the scope of the <code>CourtConfigurationChange</code>. If recreate is not selected, then only the
delta between original and current configuration is produced as render changes. By default
<code>CourtConfigurationChange</code> has recreate selected and its sub-classes do not.
