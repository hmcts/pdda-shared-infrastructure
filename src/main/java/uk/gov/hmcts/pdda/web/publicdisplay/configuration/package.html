The configuration package contains the component concerned with 'presenting' the rendering that needs to be done as
a result of the configuration of the application. The intent of the configuration component is to:
			<ul>
				<li>
Abstract the structures and concepts of configuration in a way that simplifies and decouples the render process
				</li>
				<li>
Allow the complete replacement of the user configuration components without impacting the render components.
				</li>
				<li>
Reduce the render load by providing exact information on what needs rendering.
				</li>
				<li>
Provide render change information both for configuration changes and for data changes.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
This package sets out to achieve this by presenting a single unified interface, that of the
<code>DisplayConfigurationReader</code>,the <code>RenderChanges</code>, the <code>CourtConfigurationChange</code>
classes. Most other clasases can be changed without requiring rewrite of the rest of the application providing that
the interface represented by these classes is honoured.
		</p>
		<p>
This component's interface is aware of the following concepts with no deep understanding of what
they mean:
			<ul>
				<li>
<strong>Court</strong> - Major organisational unit of configuration.
				</li>
				<li>
<strong>Display</strong> - A display has a rotation set and various court rooms assigned to it.
				</li>
				<li>
<strong>Rotation Set</strong> - A rotation set is an ordered set of several Display Documents each of which
has a specified page delay.
				</li>
				<li>
<strong>Display Document URI</strong> - A display document that has been put together with court rooms to produce information
on what needs rendering.
				</li>
				<li>
<strong>Display Rotation Set</strong> - A representation of the ordered set display document URIs attached to a display.
				</li>
				<li>
<strong>Display Document Type</strong> - A classification of the display documents and display document URIs that is used
to access a subset of the configurarion information.
				</li>
				<li>
<strong>Court Room</strong> - an identifier associated with displays, which again allows access to subsets of the configuration
data.
				</li>
			</ul>
		<p>
		<p>
There are three major classifications of 'processing' required of the configuration component, the first two are
degenerate, initialisation and configuration changes are handled in the same way. If a
<code>CourtConfigurationChange</code> or one of it's subclasses is supplied then the render changes associated with
the change/initialisation is produced. <code>CourtConfigurationChange</code>s are usually assumed to be
associated with initialisations and its subclasses are concerned with configuration changes. The third classification
is to do with render changes as a result of data changing in the underlying system. The configuration component has
no awareness of the data in the underlying system and so is asked 'What are the render changes if the involved if
the data for this court rooms associated with these display document types is changed?'. The workflow component is
concerned with the awareness of the underlying data and framing this question.
