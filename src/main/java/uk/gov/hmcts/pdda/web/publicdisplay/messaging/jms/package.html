The package contain classes for receiving public display related JMS events.
		</p>
		<p>
<code><strong>Subscription</strong></code> class provides a common abstraction to a JMS topic by specifying a message selector. Message selectors are based on court ids. The class also acts as a factory for typed subscriptions for various messaging modes. A subscription is initialized with the JMS destination, connection factory and court id. Each subscription will have an underlying event store to which it pushes the public display events received and an event work manager that pops these events from the event store and initiate document rendering. The court id is used to set a message selector on the subscription. You should call the <code>start</code> method to start JMS message reception. The method <code>startEventWorkManager</code> will start the event work manager to process the events stored in the event store by the subscription. The idea is to start JMS reception as soon as possible and start event processing once all the initialization is down. Calling the <code>shutdown</code> method will stop the event work manager and close the JMS subscription.

<code><strong>P2PSubscription</strong></code> provides publish/subscibe based messaging.
		</p>
		<p>
<code><strong>PubSubSubscription</strong></code> provides P2P based messaging.
		</p>
		<p>
<code><strong>MessageReceiver</strong></code> is responsible for asynchronously receiving JMS messages and pushing the extracted public display event to the underlying event store.
		</p>
		<p>
<code><strong>ObjectMessageTransformer</strong></code> provides an implementation based on extracting the public display event from an object message.
		</p>
		<p>
<code><strong>TextMessageTransformer</strong></code> provides an implementation that created the event from the message header properties of a text message. This is currently being used for processing daily list arrival notifications sent by Mercator.
