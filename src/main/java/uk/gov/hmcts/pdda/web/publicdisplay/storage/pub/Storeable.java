 * Description: A Storeable object is one that is Identifiable, that is it has an AbstractURI
 * associated with it and which contains textual content that can be persisted.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To encourage cleaner interfaces Storeable objects are required to implement the store() method.
 * This is <b>not</b> a callback method.#
