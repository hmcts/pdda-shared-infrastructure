/**
 * <p>
 * Title: Read/Write lock class.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Description:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This class is intended to handle the locking semantic of data that can be both read from and
 * written to, in order to prevent inconsistent data being returned at read.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The rules behind this lock are:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>Read locks and Write locks are mutually exclusive.</li>
 * <li>There can only ever be one Write lock outstanding, but pending Write locks are queued and
 * handled in turn.</li>
 * <li>There can be arbitrarily many Read locks.</li>
 * <li>One can't get a Read lock until all pending Write locks have been issued and returned.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
