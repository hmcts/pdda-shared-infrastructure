In order for these transformations to work, you will probably need to have the XSDs available to the transformer.

You can copy these out of 
the latest version of the XSDs, available in a Zip file from Kevin Nicholson.

and place them in this directory on your local machine.

I haven't copied them all into this folder in the repository because it's better only to have a single contact in the repository so that we don't have to maintain two sets of the same XSDs simultaneously.
